# Unify
Unify shares system outputs and inputs.

Still in planning stage. Likely not to be touched for a while. More important projects are taking priority.

Roadmap:
1. develop basic ui
2. implement keyboard/mouse sharing
3. implement audio sharing
4. implement webcam sharing
5. polish ui/ux

Motivation for the project: I find myself in situations where I'm using my laptop and desktop at the same time. I would like to be able to link them together so I can share a single keyboard, mouse, and set of audio equipment.
