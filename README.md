# Unify
Unify shares system outputs and inputs.

Still in planning stage.

Roadmap:
1. develop basic ui
2. implement keyboard/mouse sharing
3. implement audio sharing
4. implement webcam sharing
5. polish ui/ux

Motivation for the project: I find myself in situations where I'm using my laptop and desktop at the same time. I would like to be able to link them together so I can share a keyboard, mouse, and audio equipment.
