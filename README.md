# Unify
Unify shares system outputs and inputs. The idea is an application that lets you use two systems as if they're one.

At the moment, it is limited to sharing audio.

### To use it to share audio:
1. Download Unify Executable
2. Download and install a virtual audio cable on the machine you want to send audio from
    * I recommend https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/
3. Route any audio you want sent to the virtual audio cable
    * This can be done using window's sound mixer options page
4. Open Unify on the machine you want to send audio from
5. Select the audio device to stream from (for our purposes, this will be CABLE Output)
6. Press start on the Send Audio section
7. Open Unify on the machine you want to receive audio on
8. On the receiving machine, enter the ip address and port that are shown on the sending machine's Unify app
9. Press start under the Receive Audio section
10. Enjoy wireless audio :)

Motivation for the project: I find myself in situations where I'm using my laptop and desktop at the same time. I would like to be able to link them together so I can share a single keyboard, mouse, and set of audio equipment.
