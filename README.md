# Unify
Unify shares system outputs and inputs. It essentially lets you use your laptop and desktop as if they are displays hooked to the same computer.

Current state: sender sends the audio from the system's default audio input device to the reciever. the reciever then plays the data through it's system's output.

Roadmap:
1. develop basic ui
2. implement audio sharing
3. implement keyboard/mouse sharing
4. implement webcam sharing
5. polish ui/ux

Motivation for the project: I find myself in situations where I'm using my laptop and desktop at the same time. I would like to be able to link them together so I can share a single keyboard, mouse, and set of audio equipment.
