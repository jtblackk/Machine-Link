# Machine-Link
Machine Link shares system outputs and inputs.

Still in planning stage.

Motivation for the project: I find myself in situations where I'm using my laptop and desktop at the same time. I would like to be able to link them together so I can share a keyboard, mouse, and audio equipment.
